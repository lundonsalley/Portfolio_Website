            <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; padding:10px;">Why Thrust Vectoring is Extremely Useful for High Altitude Flights</div>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockets generally go pretty high up, but what&rsquo;s stopping them from not going up? 
                You might be thinking &ldquo;Gravity, duh&rdquo; and yep, you&rsquo;d be right. Unfortunately, gravity doesn&rsquo;t just make it difficult to lift the rocket into space, 
                it also tries to unbalance it, and turn it sideways into the Lockheed Martin special: a missile. A missile that has people in it and costs billions of dollars. 
                To put it simply, not an optimal situation. Here&rsquo;s a little home experiment for you to try: grab a long object (such as a broomstick, yardstick, metal pipe, 
                tungsten rod, guitar, etc) and hold it upright in your hand. Next, adjust the object so only a single point of it is resting on your hand/finger, and try to keep it
                upright. You should notice how it becomes very difficult to recover the item once it starts going off course, and you can bet that a couple million pound rocket would 
                love to take a quick nap instead of fighting gravity. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But luckily, there&rsquo;s a solution to this potentially lethal problem: fins! Fins work wonderfully to help keep the rocket pointed toward the skies instead of the ground. They can be designed to create a controlled roll on the rocket to
                create a gyroscopic effect, creating even more stability. As with all good things, there are downsides. Fins cause drag, which is something many engineers hate with a 
                passion, as it prevents a lot of cool things like supersonic cows and massive fuel efficiency for the Toyota Prius. Drag (not talking about drag queens here) is
                everywhere, but if it can be reduced, it cascades into massive savings; a black friday for engineers so to speak. Another big problem with fins, and all aerodynamic 
                surfaces for that matter, don&rsquo;t work well without air. Hence the &lsquo;aero&rsquo; part in the name. This makes fins largely ineffective once the air is gone, 
                which is where many rockets enjoy going to. Fins stop being effective outside of the atmosphere because with no particle flow over the surface, it has nothing to push 
                against. A similar situation would be leaning against a wall, and then someone is really sanding down the other side until eventually, you can&rsquo;t lean against it 
                anymore.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us back to the famous &lsquo;large missile pointed in unknown direction&rsquo; problem. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a nifty
                solution to controlling rockets without the need of aerodynamic surfaces like fins. Thrust vector control is found in nearly all modern rockets for this exact reason.
                It allows for a more aerodynamic rocket, and can control itself in space without worrying about a premature reentry (not good) and wasting billions of dollars that 
                could have been spent on making </span><span class="c1">real</span><span>&nbsp;missiles. Thrust vectoring works by moving the nozzle of the rocket engine so it can 
                tilt in the correct directions. The change of the thrust angle creates a torque on the rocket, which has no relationship with the atmosphere. In fact, it works
                much better in a vacuum because the air is no longer trying to force the rear of the rocket back in line with its flight path. </span></p>

            <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; padding:10px;"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tutorial</span></p></div>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece was a tutorial on how to set up a thrust vectoring simulation in Mathlab&rsquo;s 
                SimuLink using SimScape Multibodies. My audience was student engineers and anyone interested in creating simulations using simulink. Since the info is useful for other 
                simulations that aren&rsquo;t TVC, I had a secondary audience of people trying to learn simulink. First, I covered how to export the file from SolidWorks, converting it 
                into a usable SimuLink file, which was one of the least documented steps online, and was generally pretty vague. I think including this was effective since I was able to 
                clearly convey the steps and where to find the missing ones. Next, I covered the creation of the simulink file to begin the simulation. I chose to cover each step in depth, 
                allowing for viewers to easily replicate what I was doing. I left out some of the details that were only relevant to my specific situation, but I mentioned what I was leaving 
                out in case it was info a viewer could find useful. Overall, I think this was relatively effective, as I was able to clearly show how to achieve it. I appealed to ethos by 
                showing my audience that it can be achieved, with proof of the simulation working at the end.</span></p>
            <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; padding:10px;"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Youtube Shorts</span></p></div>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece was an educational series on how thrust vectoring works, the history behind it, 
                and why it&#39;s used. My audience was Gen Z/Gen Alpha students that have an interest in rockets. Following the Youtube Shorts/TikTok standard conventions of short 
                form content, I played a video of Minecraft Parkour with many popular meme clips over the screen to increase viewer retention. The overedited nature meant to enhance 
                the learning experience by making it entertaining, funny, and fast paced. I also included rapidly updating captions that can also take up the viewers attention, if they 
                want to retain more of the finer details instead of only ingesting the info through memes. I bolstered my pathos by making the audience feel amused and entertained, 
                which in turn allowed me to educate them about rocket engines. I think these were very effective at conveying surface-level information, which could trigger intrigue for 
                further research (my research paper, perhaps?). I do believe they lacked some of the deeper and finer details that I would have wished to include, but I felt that 
                I would be overloading the viewer&rsquo;s attention if I threw too many terms and definitions at them at once. </span></p>
            <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; padding:10px;"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Humor Journal Article</span></p></div>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece was a short article about why fins don&#39;t work at high altitudes, 
                and why TVC fixes that issue. My audience is engineers and people in the STEM field, as some of the knowledge required for the humor or general information is 
                easily understood by those with any STEM background. I again used pathos through humor and also used logos by explaining why the fins don&rsquo;t work in relatively 
                simple terms. I chose to include an experiment for the readers to do as a way to reinforce the learning, and to have a bit of fun. The laid-back tone made the article 
                feel less like &ldquo;fins bad, use TVC&rdquo; and instead casually explained why TVC has some advantages, while explaining why fins fail during those conditions. The 
                lack of a strong argumentative tone leans away from pushing the idea upon the reader, but to instead encourage it, with supporting evidence. I also chose to leave out a 
                counter argument because I felt it would compromise the tone, as I have no reason to defend it. I feel it was effective in educating, but certainly lacked in arguments. 
                The lack was intentional, but the article could have easily been modified to fit in an counter, which could have bolstered the argument for TVC over fins. </span></p>
