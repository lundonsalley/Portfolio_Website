    <p>This piece is a free write brainstorm of what topics I wanted to do my research paper on. I ended up not choosing any of these ideas, and instead opted to write about 
      thrust vector control in rockets. Although none of these were used, it was still very important to my decision making process. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I chose to include this piece because I feel it shows some of the process I go through to create my writing. I normally cannot just start writing without some sort of brainstorming 
      or thought-dumping.
    </p>

    <p>This piece reflects my work in this class by showing my thinking before writing. I previously never spent much time planning for a writing piece, and just started writing 
      things down when I needed to turn it in. As I've matured and grown, I've started to put more effort and thought into my writing to make it the best that I can.

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I would like to research either stealth technology or how different planets affect robots.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I feel like the stealth technology would be hard to research, as most of it is probably classified by the DoD, but I think the research on how to deal with environments on other planets and still allow robots to function correctly would be interesting. For example, Mars&#39; lack of atmosphere leads to more radiation, and I wonder if it also correlates to more bits to be flipped by cosmic rays because of that lack of protection. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How does AI impact students learning to code?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How will humans be able to survive interplanetary travel?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What types of engines are best for deep space travel?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What are the best ways to land a robot onto a planet that doesn&rsquo;t have an atmosphere?</span></p>
