    <p>This piece is my personal narrative from my English 11 class in high school. 
    <br><br>
    <p>I chose to include this piece because I wrote the narrative in a single class period, and made nearly zero revisions on it since. I even ended up getting over 100% on the paper.
      This piece highlighted less of my technical abilites, but instead showcased my creativity and word choice. Finally, it demonstrates my skill of 'write it once, but write it well', 
      as I prefrer to make my revisions as I write instead of doing multiple drafts with heavy revisions. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This piece reflects my understanding of writing by showcasing my choice of words, story telling, and my abiltiy to transribe my emotions. All of these are skills I don't practice often
      as an engineer, but are valuable regardless. The piece also challenged me by setting a word maximum (600), which was something I had never had to deal with before. I never struggled to
      meet a word minimum, but working within a set number of words made me consider how impactful each word was, and if it was required to impart my message on my audience.

  <div class="text-wrapper">
    <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;"><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c0">Eye of the Storm</span></p></div>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cyclone of memories and emotions, flashing, swirling through my head, 
      creating an incessant din to remind me of everything I had done wrong. I had thousands of chances to prevent this, to prevent this exact moment I dreaded 
      would come. Was there any chance to fix such an obvious mistake? &nbsp;</span>
    <span class="c0 c1">No. No, this time was different.</span>
    <span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;No way to fix this. No do-overs. A mistake and a lesson to be forever branded into the depths of my whirling brain, a warning to 
      never allow such a careless mistake ever happen again. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape. I drive my feet down into the unyielding plastic and metal of my bike. 
      Escape. My legs strain with the unexpected aggression I had for each motion. Escape. </span><span class="c0">Lungs screaming in protest from the frigid January night air</span>
    <span class="c3 c0">, forced in and out, allowing my legs to push harder, faster. All just to try and escape from the thoughts poisoning my mind, as if each turn of my pedals 
      would carry me further away from what I feared I could never escape.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <span class="c0">Streetlights, flickering off and on, beckoning moths towards its eerie glow.</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;If only I had heard the warnings the streetlights were whispering at me, to turn around, to go back. But my thoughts had taken over me, 
      driving me forward with no regard to consequence or danger. </span><span class="c0">My legs shot white hot pain up my legs</span>
    <span class="c3 c0">, begging the relentless strain to end. Finally, I could take it no longer. I gave my legs a short reprise, only long enough 
      to shut them up so I could continue. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train station, dimly lit by only two poorly cleaned lamp posts with their far-past-warranty bulbs.
      No people in sight. My thoughts lull, wondering instead if the trains even run at this hour. It seemed like they didn&rsquo;t. The ocean fog had thickened, obscuring 
      the lights even further, leaving my eyes struggling to make out even the most basic of shapes. </span>
    <span class="c0 c1">It&rsquo;s probably best if I leave.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheeling around, I turn out of the station, and up to behind the cinema, the neon lights only 
      lighting up part of the sign, spelling out only a fraction of what it should have said. In a flash of the lights, the thoughts and fragments in my mind spun back up to their
      destructive crescendo after its short recess. </span><span class="c0 c1">Why did they have to come back?</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;Slamming my feet back into my pedals, my bike squeaking and groaning from the unexpected force upon its chain, I dart away, toward the main road, and 
      away from the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;dark and menacing</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;alleyways. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright lights everywhere, each establishment advertising their own unique goods and services,
      trying to grab the attention of anyone that walked by. </span><span class="c0">Axe</span>
    <span class="c3 c0">Throwing! Arcade! 5 Grand Autoland! So many wonderful and exciting things to do! Instead of drawing me in, the lights drove me away, up the hill toward the 
      darkness again. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only I could stay in this darkness forever, the cold ocean wind whipping my hair wildly around my face, city lights growing fainter with each 
      turn of my bike chain. The incline got steeper and more aggressive, but I never downshifted, instead pushing harder against the hills unforgiving asphalt. Legs burning once again, 
      I had reached the top. The flurry of thoughts had begun to lull once again. </span><span class="c0 c1">Breathe</span><span class="c0">, I told myself, </span>
    <span class="c0 c1">Just breathe and make peace.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;So I did. Inhale. Pause. Exhale. Pause. Repeat. I close my eyes and let the thoughts consume me
      for a moment. I feel them, I become them, and the thoughts become me. I hold them there for an instant, a snapshot of their unforgiving and destructive potential, and then set
      them free.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence. No more </span><span class="c0">cyclone</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;of thoughts and emotions. No more torrential rains of memories bombarding my skull. Just&hellip; silence. </span></p>
