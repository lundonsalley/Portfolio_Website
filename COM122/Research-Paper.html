    <p>This piece is a research paper I wrote on how thrust vector control can be achieved by undergraduate students. It covers the math, materials, code, techniques, and other details. 
    </p>

    <p>I chose to include this piece because it showcases both my work ethic and strengths. I was able to write this entierly in LaTeX, learned the complex 4-dimentional math, cited my
      sources in IEEE with no experience with IEEE, and produced this piece in only a few short days. While LaTeX and using IEEE wern't required, I felt these skills would help me greatly
      in my career, especially if I do grad/post-grad research.
    </p>

    <p>This piece reflects my work in this class by showing off my creative blend of technical skills and research abilities. This paper was also my first research paper, and I really
      enjoyed this style over textual analysis.
