    <p>This piece is a rhetorical analysis on a song and music video that I felt had a lot of deeper meaning to it. I've lisented to Falling in Reverse for 
      quite a while, and the drama and new lore never gets old, especially with their lead singer, Ronne Radke's personality.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I chose to include this piece because I'm proud of how it turned out. It was nearly 2,000 words, and I wrote the majority of it in a single sitting. I also 
      chose this piece because I felt it also represented my interests. I love rock, metal, guitar, and beautiful musical masterpieces, which "Prequel" encapsulated
      beautifully into a single song. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This piece reflects my understanding of writing by showcasing my ability to analyze mixed media, draw out the deeper meaning, and synthesize it into a cohesive piece. 
      Furthermore, it also combines visual analysis, auditory analysis, and lyrical/textual analysis in a single piece, which showcases multiple different aspects of my skills.

    <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;"><p class="c6"><span class="c4">COM122 Rhetorical Analysis - </span><span class="c4 c10">&quot;Prequel&quot;</span><span
        class="c4">&nbsp;by Fall</span><span class="c4">ing in Reverse</span></p>
        </div>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
        class="c4">Falling</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in Reverse, a popular rock band from the 2000s has become one of
        the most discussed bands in the media due to their lead singer Ronnie Radke&rsquo;s controversies, incredible
        vocal ranges, seamless multi-genre songs, and the band&rsquo;s utterly stunning music videos.
        &quot;Prequel&quot;</span><span class="c4">, the opening of Falling in Reverse&rsquo;s album </span><span
        class="c0">Popular Monster</span><span class="c4">, sets the mood for the following songs, showcasing
        Radke&rsquo;s rage and fed-up attitude. Instead of trying to write a vague and generic song that any fan could
        relate to, Radke chose to </span><span class="c4">write &quot;Prequel&quot;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in the
        form of a warning message. A warning message to show the world how blind they&rsquo;ve become, how they follow
        without thinking, how they listen to the voice of authority without question, and how dangerous the lack of
        individuality has become. </span></p>
    <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnie</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Radke&rsquo;s rage was born from his
      </span><span class="c4">incident</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;at Six Flags and his expulsion from his original
        band, Escape the Fate. During a concert at Six Flags, Radke threw a microphone stand into the crowd, just as he
        had done many times before, but that time the stand injured two fans (NBC 6, 2012). Radke&rsquo;s anger over
        this incident wasn&rsquo;t that the fans missed the stand, but that everyone hated him for it when the people
        who were injured in the incident publicly forgave Radke, and didn&rsquo;t even blame him for it. In an interview
        with Rock Feed, Radke exclaims, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have people that weren&#39;t even born when I threw a mic
        stand into the crowd, mad at me. You weren&#39;t even born, bro!&rdquo; (Radke, 2024). His other tipping point
        was how his criminal past is frequently brought up, specifically with his detainment for possession of brass
        knuckles and battery charges, leading to his first band kicking him out (Rolling Stone, 2012). Although Radke
        has stayed out of legal trouble for over eight years, he still has many other unpopular opinions and tendencies,
        such as fighting with his fans on Twitter or major social media meltdowns. His quick-to-rise anger and easily
        pushable buttons make his social media posts downright volatile, with no restraint for his fans, lashing out
        with phrases like &ldquo;Can y&rsquo;all stop being pissed at me so I can release this music video?&rdquo; quite
        frequently (Radke, 2024). His anger at his fans and critics is rampant throughout &ldquo;Prequel,&rdquo; calling
        them out and speaking to them directly for large swatches of the song. </span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a petty jab at Ronnie
        Radke&rsquo;s community, the cover for </span><span class="c0">Popular Monster</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is
        Radke&rsquo;s mugshot from when he was incarcerated, showing a bit more of his childish behavior towards his
        supporters. The first song on the album, &quot;Prequel&quot;</span><span class="c0">,</span><span
        class="c4">&nbsp;begins with a low, resonant upright bass, setting a dark and foreboding tone for Radke to kick
        off the lyrics in a low chant. He speaks first about how he&rsquo;s trying to become a &ldquo;better
        human,&rdquo; but he can&rsquo;t because everyone is tearing him down (Radke, 2024). Simultaneously, a priest is
        shown placing a crown of thorns on Radke&rsquo;s head in the music video, which symbolizes the mockery of his
        idolization to parallel the Roman soldiers placing a crown of thorns on Jesus. Instead of fighting back against
        the people who don&#39;t want him to succeed, Radke shifts from trying to change himself, to instead admitting
        that he&rsquo;s the kind of person they think he is, a &ldquo;</span><span class="c4">cynical</span><span
        class="c3">, egotistical, unpredictable, harden&#1077;d criminal&rdquo; (Radke, 2024). By admitting his negative
        qualities, he ditches his public image to give the critics what they want to hear, and in turn, hands him all
        the leverage he needs to call them out for not admitting how fake they all are. </span></p>
    <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radke then begins strengthening his ethos by embracing everything he&rsquo;s done,
        everything he&rsquo;s gone through, and admits that he&rsquo;d never change any of it, as it all &ldquo;made
        [him] the person [he is] today&rdquo; (Radke, 2024). During Radke&rsquo;s &lsquo;speech&rsquo;, he&rsquo;s
        depicted delivering it to a battalion of soldiers in the square below the citadel&rsquo;s tower and ends it with
        a fist thrown high into the air to reflect his pride in how far he&rsquo;s made it. Radke mentions in his Rock
        Feed interview that he struggled to rebuild himself after his imprisonment, especially trying to write Falling
        in Reverse&rsquo;s debut album, </span><span class="c0">The Drug in Me Is You,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;from
        his cell, saying it was &ldquo;sort of embarrassing, you know, there&rsquo;s like a bunch of gangsters in there,
        and I&rsquo;m all like &hellip; singing like an Emo or something&rdquo; (Radke, 2024). Radke&rsquo;s story
        isn&rsquo;t all sunshine and rainbows, but his hard work and sheer talent cannot and should not be written off
        because of a few moments in his past. </span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radke then enters the second verse
        almost identically to how he began the first verse, but this time, he ponders the irony of his dreams of
        everyone admiring him. And with that thought of irony, he twists his words to attack his critics once again, but
        this time, more directly. He begins to call out to the listener using words like &lsquo;you&rsquo; and
        &lsquo;y&rsquo;all&rsquo; to add a more personal touch to his words. While singing this, Radke finds himself
        being followed by hundreds of townsfolk, and they all begin to mimic his movements, comparable to how fans look
        up to their idols and want to be just like them. He then once again ramps up his vocals with the music, this
        time with even more intensity, emphasizing his warnings with every beat. He closes the verse with a threat of
        violence, emboldened by his history of &ldquo;battery with substantial bodily harm,&rdquo; one that encourages
        anyone trying to stand against him to &ldquo;back the fuck up, get out of [his] face&rdquo; (Las Vegas Weekly,
        2008; Radke, 2024). Radke&rsquo;s threats to the world are meant to show how fed up he is with how the world is
        treating him for his past, and that he&rsquo;s not going to take any more of it. </span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radke switches his strategy of pathos
        to a verse of logos, forming logical and thought-provoking situations to force the listener to think
        introspectively. Entering the third verse, Radke wastes no time jumping straight into it to maintain his
        momentum from the second verse but chooses to calm the music back down to allow his words of advice to strike
        the audience harder. He uses the verse as his rallying speech, to whip up his followers into a frenzy to help
        him on his crusade against his critics. Radke points out the hypocrisy in the current (as of 2024) generations,
        telling them that &ldquo;[they&#39;re] a slave to labor and [they] praise the fascist / [They] kiss the hand
        that takes half in taxes&rdquo; to lift the veil from their eyes and show them who they should be angry at
        (Radke, 2024). During this shot in the music video, the aforementioned townsfolk are all bowing down to a
        massive statue of Radke, all praising him for trying to break them free from slavery. </span></p>
    <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radke then uses the anger the critics are holding against him and redirects it
        toward the real enemy in his eyes, the corrupt government. He then wraps up the third verse with a few somewhat
        unsettling lines, such as &ldquo;prepare to die, prepare to burn&rdquo; and &ldquo;all our gods abandoned
        us,&rdquo; not to scare the crowd away, but to inform them of the sacrifice that is required to stand against
        the majority and fight against the corruption and the system it created (Radke, 2024). Finally, he ends the
        verse with </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Light the match / watch it burn&rdquo; to
        signify their actions are only a catalyst, and that the downfall will surely follow (Radke, 2024). </span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
        class="c4">With</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the symbolic lighting of the match to burn the world</span><span
        class="c4">,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Radke is thrown backward off the citadel tower by the priest and sent
        tumbling through the air onto a Latin cross in the center of a massive Colosseum, followed by nails to hold his
        hands and feet to the cross, completing the crucifixion. The crowds of townsfolk that had followed him are
        depicted booing Radke, reminiscent of how his fans turned on him after he threw a mic stand into the crowd. He
        then turns to look at the people gathered in the Colosseum, and shoots giant red lasers from his eyes,
        destroying the Colosseum, and then the heavens above.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final verse, Radke returns to
        his tactic of pathos, pulling from his emotional lines and angelic high notes. Radke&rsquo;s tone shifts from
        rapping to incredibly emotional operatic vocals, along with an instrumental shift from occasional drums and low
        orchestra to massive double kicks, resounding backing vocals, heavy distortion guitars, and angelic supporting
        choirs. The lines &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">When everything falls apart,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why have you
        forsaken me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heavy is the crown, you see</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; are repeated
        throughout, with the first line appearing most frequently (Radke, 2024). The first line refers to how nothing
        can last forever, that even the greatest empires, the greatest kingdoms, and the greatest leaders all have an
        end. Radke uses this as a metaphor for how his life fell apart and how he can project that fall onto everyone
        else. In the second line, he asks the world why they have forsaken him, as they had once praised him. He uses
        this to show how quickly the world can turn on anyone, after just one action, and void every good thing
        they&rsquo;ve done. Finally, in the third line, Radke claims his crown is heavy, as the responsibility of being
        a leader is weighing him down. The weight of being an idol, to please everyone, to be perfect is too much for
        anyone to maintain, and it will inevitably &ldquo;fall apart,&rdquo; just as it will for anyone (Radke, 2024).
      </span></p>
    <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the final sequence, Radke is shown floating into the sky, with the white
        angels from above pulling him upwards while the dark angels from below try to pull him down, representing the
        pull of both ways of life, and both ways he could be remembered for years to come. Instead of choosing between
        the good and bad, Radke obliterates all of the angels around him in a monumental shockwave, letting him choose
        his own path, to pave his own way, and to write his own destiny. Following his obliteration of the angels, a
        colossus in his likeness begins to crumble, crushing the worshippers, and signifying the end of his time to be
        idolized, and to instead become who he wants to be. </span></p>
    <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnie Radke&rsquo;s tirade of a song effectively warns the audience of the
        dangers of blindly following authority, merging with the group mentality, and lacking individuality by using his
        vocal styles to invoke emotions of anger, sadness, triumph, and fear in the listener, drawing upon the
        audience&rsquo;s pathos. Furthermore, the accompanying music video captures the pathos to a different level,
        allowing Radke to successfully convey his emotions and the emotions he wants his audience to feel while watching
        and listening to his song. </span><span class="c0">&quot;</span><span class="c4">Prequel</span><span
        class="c0">&quot;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;works with the rest of the album to frame every emotion on the
        album into one song and then dive into each emotion in a later song, allowing a deeper and more fluid flow to
        the album. </span></p>
